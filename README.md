# Fog Based AI Framework for Accurate Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease

## üìö Overview

This project presents an AI-based framework deployed over a fog computing architecture to enable accurate and early detection of **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**. The primary objective is to leverage edge/fog computing to reduce latency and enable real-time analysis of patient health data for timely diagnosis and intervention.

## üß† Key Features

- ‚úÖ Machine Learning model trained for early-stage CKD detection
- üå´Ô∏è Integration with fog computing nodes for real-time processing
- üìâ High accuracy and low latency diagnostic system
- üè• Edge deployment for smart healthcare systems
- üìä Interactive dashboard for medical professionals

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system consists of three layers:

1. **IoT Layer** ‚Äì Collects health parameters such as blood pressure, glucose, etc.
2. **Fog Layer** ‚Äì Processes data locally with the ML model to provide fast diagnosis.
3. **Cloud Layer** ‚Äì Stores historical data and provides model updates.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Python** ‚Äì Core programming language
- **Scikit-learn / XGBoost / TensorFlow** ‚Äì ML frameworks
- **Flask / FastAPI** ‚Äì Backend API for inference
- **Docker** ‚Äì Containerization for fog node deployment
- **Node-RED / MQTT** ‚Äì Edge device communication
- **Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano** ‚Äì Fog nodes (optional)
- **Grafana / Streamlit** ‚Äì Visualization dashboard

## üß™ Dataset

The model is trained on the **UCI Chronic Kidney Disease dataset**. It includes features like:
- Age
- Blood pressure
- Blood glucose level
- Serum creatinine
- Albumin
- Hemoglobin
- etc.

> Note: Dataset preprocessing handles missing values, normalization, and label encoding.
